60 years ago, the biggest tragedy in motorsport history took place during the famous 24-hour race in Le Mans, France. Over 80 people died on that day in an accident that shaped modern motorsport in many ways. We wanted to tell the story that led up to this disaster, the tragedy itself and the consequences learnt.

We had 5 days to turn a reddit post about the tragedy into a website.
