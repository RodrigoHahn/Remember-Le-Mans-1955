      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        1955 Le Mans was labeled as WW2 on the track. Mercedes and the might of German manufacturing versus the 'Garagistes' of Great Britain and their low-key high-success rate of garage-built manufacturing. New technologies including disc brakes and aero brakes were being introduced along with ever advancing speeds and lightweight chassis development. But all was not the same for Circuit de La Sarthe.

        It was a dated and dangerous track that was suited for the cars of 20 years prior; not the 180 MPH sportscars that were inches from death every lap. The front straight featured a slight kink onto the pit straight with completely exposed pitting area. Safety was regarded as something that might happen, and preventative measures were not implemented until an accident occured highlighting the issue.

      <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
      <p>
      Immediately following the crash, spectators were told minimal details of the accident, as to keep the roadways clear for emergency personnel. The organizers would receive flak for not abandoning the race after the aftermath of the the disaster was concluded. Word quickly began to spread through the pits and to another Mercedes driver, American John Fitch, who suggested to Mercedes to withdraw from the race. At midnight, Mercedes pulled the then-leading car of Fangio-Moss, and John Fitch's 300 SLR. Mercedes after 1955 would not again race for 30 years. Mike Hawthorne went on to take victory and was scorned by the French papers for his victory and celebrations after the race. He went on to win the Formula 1 World Championship but would die in a traffic accident in 1959 ironically overtaking a 300SL. Lance Macklin refuted Mike Hawthornes claim that he was at fault, and sued Mike Hawthorne for libel.
      Le Mans changed after this, the kink was lessened, pit road was widened, as well as pit straight. The old stands were torn down, moved back, and rebuilt for further safety, and the track around the front straight was made safer. It is still the worst tragedy and loss of human life in motorsports history. It was the darkest day for motorsports, caused one car manufacturer to withdraw from racing for 30 years, and caused a nation to ban motorsports in their country. It serves as a focal point for the 'Wild West' attitudes of safety and speed between the awakened need for safety. John Fitch dedicated his life after racing to improve safety not only in race cars but road cars as well. It is something we should never forget as we reflect on 60 years since its tragedy.
